    <pre><strong>Nature</strong> is an inherent character or constitution,<sup>[1]</sup>
         particularly of the <strong>ecosphere</strong> or the <strong>ecosphere</strong> as a whole.
          In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements 
          and <sup>phenomena</sup> of the physical world, including life. 
          Although humans are part of nature,
         human activity or humans as a whole are often described as 
         at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature. <sub>[2]</sub></pre>
